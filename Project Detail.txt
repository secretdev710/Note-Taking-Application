Task Overview: Simple Note-Taking Application
Create a "Note-Taking Application" that allows users to create, edit, delete, and organize notes with basic authentication.

Front-End (React.js):
Create a React.js application with the following pages:

Login/Register Page: Allow users to sign up or log in.
Notes List Page: Display a list of the user's notes with options to edit or delete.
Add/Edit Note Page: A form for adding a new note or editing an existing one.
User Profile Page (Optional): Show user information with the option to edit details.
Use React Router for navigation and React Hooks for handling state. Consider using Context API for managing global authentication state.

Implement form validation for fields like title and content in the add/edit note form.

Use a UI library like Material-UI or Tailwind CSS to make the app look clean and responsive.

Back-End (Node.js or Laravel):
Create a RESTful API using Node.js (Express.js) or Laravel:

User Authentication: Implement JWT-based authentication.
CRUD Operations:
Notes: Create, read, update, and delete.
Database requirements:

Use MongoDB (for Node.js) or MySQL (for Laravel).

User schema/table:

id
username
email
password (hashed)
created_at, updated_at
Note schema/table:
id
user_id (reference to User)
title
content
created_at, updated_at
Use middleware to ensure that only authenticated users can access the note-related routes.

Features:
User Authentication:

Users can register, log in, and stay logged in with JWT tokens.
Note Management:

Users can create, edit, delete, and view notes.
Each note should have a title and content.
Search Notes:

Provide a search bar on the notes list page to search notes by title.
Additional Functionalities:
Categories (Optional):

Allow users to categorize notes (e.g., Work, Personal, Ideas).
Implement a simple filter to view notes by category.
Markdown Support (Optional):

Support basic Markdown formatting for note content.
User Profile Management:

Allow users to update their profile information.
Bonus Tasks (Optional):
Note Archiving: Add the ability to archive notes instead of deleting them.
Tagging: Allow users to add tags to notes and filter by tags.
Testing: Implement basic API endpoint tests using a testing library.
Dark Mode: Add a toggle for light and dark themes.
Submission Requirements:
A GitHub repository link to the project.
A README.md file with setup instructions.
Database configuration instructions (MongoDB or MySQL).
Documentation for the API endpoints.
This task is straightforward and focuses on essential features like user authentication, CRUD operations, search functionality, and form handling.**
